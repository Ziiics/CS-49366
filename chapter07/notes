Disks and Disk Partitions

The tracks is basically a cylinder.
Each secor is a section, but a block can be multiple sector.
It actually takes very long for the toner to change tracks when it need to look for the data  \\we call this seeking), 
  so instead of placing memory to different tracks in the same cylinder,
  it actually keep file in different cylinder but the same tracks.

Device driver: is the one that connect the program to the devices (kenerl addressabel on kernel only).
The job is to talk to the devices and to the kernel.
- upper half
- lower half

Most file system stays on the disks.
We can check the file or memeory on the disks on /proc

The filesystem we are talking about is focussin on the ext file.

The goal is ot implement the stat() command
