int get_int(char *arg, int flags, int *value, char *msg)
  // process a string input 'arg' and attempt to convert it to an integer based on 'flags'
  char* arg [IN] â€“ input string to parse, provided by caller
  int flags [IN] - specify how to handle anomalies during parsing (allowed condition of arg)
  int* value [OUT] - pointer to an integer where the function will store the parsed number if successful
  char* msg [OUT] - pointer to a character array where an error message will be stored if parsing fails

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
  // send any signal to any process group or process
  #include <signal.h>
  pid_t pid - target process identifier (PID) to be sent, based on the value below, signal will be send to:
    > 0   : the process with the specified PID.
    == 0  : all processes in the process group of the calling process.
    < -1  : all processes in the process group whose ID is the absolute value of pid.
    == -1 : all processes for which the calling process has permission to send signals, except for process 1 (init).
  int sig - signal number to be sent, some common ones are:
    SIGTERM (15): politely asking to terminate a process
    SIGKILL (9): temrinate process immediately, CAN'T BE IGNORED
    SIGSTOP (19): pause process, CAN'T BE IGNORED
    SIGCONT (18): resume paused process
    SIGALRM (15): timer signal from alarm()

unsigned sleep(unsigned seconds);
  // cause the calling thread to be suspended from execution until time elapsed
  #include <unistd.h>

int raise(int sig);
  // sends signal 'sig' to the calling process or thread
  #include <signal.h>

sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);
  // sets the disposition of the signal signum to handler
  // Avoid its use: use sigaction(2) instead
  // The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored.
  #include <signal.h>
  int signum - the signal number to handle
  sighandler_t handler - pointer to the signal handling function of the specified signal
    SIG_IGN to ignore the signal.
    SIG_DFL to reset the handling to its default behavior.

usleep(3)
int usleep(useconds_t usec);
  /// suspends the execution of calling thread for 'usec' microseconds
  #include <unistd.h>

volatile sig_atomic_t got_interrupt= 0;
  // handle changes that occur outside the normal execution flow of a program
  // it is volatile bcs the program can always get interrupt
  volatile - used to tell compiler that the value of a variable can change anytime
  sig_atomic_t - int type that is guaranteed atomic completed in single step
  got_interrupt - a flag to indicate if there's signal coming and interrupt the running program

ssize_t write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
  // write nbyte bytes from the buffer pointer to by buf to the file fildes
  // returns the number of bytes that weree actually written
  #include <unistd.h>

struct sigaction sigact - declares struct sigaction variable to specify how signals are handled

struct sigaction {
  void     (*sa_handler)(int);
  void     (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);

  int        sa_flags;
  void     (*sa_restorer)(void);
};

sigact.sa_handler = on_interrupt; // caught a signal
sigemptyset(&sigact.sa_mask); // furthur signal that is same with the current handled signal will not be blocked until completion
sigact.sa_flags = 0; // not using special signal handling which means syscalls won't start automatically

int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);
  // initializes and empty a signal set
  #include <signal.h>

int sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction *restrict act, struct sigaction *restrict oact);
  // examine and change a signal action
  #include <signal.h>
  int sig - specifies the signal number which action will be change
  const struct sigaction *restrict act - pointer to a struct sigaction structure that defines the new action
    Contains several fields:
      - sa_handler or sa_sigaction: Specifies the handler function or action when the signal is received.
      - sa_mask: A set of signals to be blocked during the execution of the signal handling function.
      - sa_flags: Flags that modify the behavior of the signal handling; 
          ex: SA_RESTART to make certain interrupted system calls restart automatically.
  struct sigaction *restrict oact - OPTIONAL, If not null, sigaction() will save the previous action of specified signal sig in the oact

int tcflush(int fildes, int queue_selector);
  #include <termios.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  fildes - file dscriptor of the device to flush
  queue_selector - value that specifies which queue to flush, possible values:
    TCIFLUSH - flushes input queue
    TCOFLUSH - flushes output queue
    TCIOFLUSH - flush both

	int si_band;      // band event for SIGPOLL/SIGIO
} siginfo_t;

sigset_t
  // a type representing a signal set, used by signal blocking functions to specify which signals are affected.
  // because blocked signal has occured but is still pending, 
  // sigset_t passed to sigpending containes the pending signals for the calling process

const char *sigabbrev_np(int sig);
  // returns abbreviated name of signal sig

  // In the sigaction structure, the sa_flags field can be used to modify the behavior of a specified signal. 
  // When the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the sa_flags field, the sa_sigaction field specifies a signal-catching function

void* memset (void* ptr, int value, size_t num);
  // sets sets the first 'num' bytes of the block of memory pointer by 'ptr' to the specified 'value'
  void* ptr - pointer to the block of memory to fill
  int value - value to be set
  size_t num - num of bytes to send to value

int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signo);
  // add a signal to signal set, have to sigemptyset() or sigfillset() at least once prior to any other use of that object
  #include <signal.h>
  sigset_t *set - the set fo signal to be deleted from
  int signo - signal number from the set

int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *_Nullable restrict set, sigset_t *_Nullable restrict oldset);
  // examine and change the signal mask of the calling thread
  #include <signal.h>
  int how - how the signal mask should be changed, the value options are
    SIG_BLOCK - signals specified in 'set' are added to the current signal mask
    SIG_UNBLOCK - signals specified in 'set' are removed from the current signal mask
    SIG_SETMASK - signals specified in 'set' becomes the new signal mask replacing the current mask
  const sigset_t *_Nullable restrict set - set of signals to be updated
  sigset_t *_Nullable restrict oldset - pointer to a sigset_t 
    if its NULL, the previous value of the mask won't be stored 
    if not NULL, signal mask is unchanged and 'how' is ignored
