Advanced concept of I/O

lseek() is to repositions the file offset.
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
  - fd: file descriptor 
  - offset: argument offset according to the directive  
  - whence: the directive accordance to offset as follow,
    - SEEK_SET: file offset is set to offset bytes.
    - SEEK_CUR: is set to its current location plus offset bytes.
    - SEEK_END: The file offset is set to the size of the file plus offset bytes.

lseek() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the file (does not change the size of the file)
